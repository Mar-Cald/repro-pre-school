# 📝 APA Quarto Example

This page shows the **Quarto source** and the **rendered Word document** (in APA style) directly in-browser.


## 📄 View `.docx` Output Inline

You can view the `.docx` below. This uses Microsoft Office's live embed feature:

<iframe 
  src="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/embed.aspx?src=https://mar-cald.github/repro-pre-school/example-compendium/analysis/paper/example.docx" 
  width="100%" 
  height="600px" 
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>

> ℹ️ If the preview doesn’t load, make sure your site is deployed over HTTPS and the `.docx` is in the `files/` folder.
